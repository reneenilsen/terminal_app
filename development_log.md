I started by doing user stories. Firstly I broke each function I wanted for my terminal app into seperate lists (walk, encounter, catch) and wrote all the features into seperate lists to ensure maximum readabilty and ease. I also gave each task a label of high, med and low complexity. I drew up my flow chart of how and what I wanted to do and run in my app. I started by working on the walk function, I wanted to be able to move 4 directions. I needed to ask the user to give an direction and get the input and then move the given direction and print the direction then start loop again. I really struggled with combining all the lessons and exersises into my own situation.

I was really struggling interpting lessons into what I was doing with my app so I wrote out the pseudocode in detail and then write a mash of code I knew with the pseudocode, it was messy and probably very difficult to understand as an outsider but it worked and it ran as a app. Because this I was able to identify what classes, variables, functions and calcualtions I needed to make this app. I started to pull out different pieces and create code that conformed to 'best practice' or as close as I could.

The code is up and running finally. It preforms what I wanted it to do, which is to walk around, encounter pokemon and have the ability to catch them. I am still having problems with wrong inputs but it currently ignores them and moves on to the next step in the heirachy. I have also added a berry feature, where you can give a pokemon a berry to increase the chance of catching it and adding the Pokemon's level to the catch rate to increase the diificulty of the catch. Ascii art for the title has been added. I have also added colour to the output strings to make it a little easier to read. Tests have been running throughout the proccess with outputs prints to the screen to check catch rate, spawns rates and calculations with adding berry and adding Pokemon's level.
